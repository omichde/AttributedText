# AttributedText

Using this view in SwiftUI is a simple as `AttributedText(attributedString)` and hence closely resembles the simplicity of `Text`.
The content of the text is width-constrained (it grows in height) and self-contained (no other dependencies).

There is an example where some more fancy attributed strings are shown and how the content:

- properly word wrap into its width constrained container
- show custom font assignment
- show word-by-word styling including links (which open externally)
- show an image alongside a text

## Example

This simplified code contains background colors and bars for testing purposes only:

```swift
let weirdText: NSAttributedString = {
	let quote = "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy üêï."
	let str = NSMutableAttributedString(string: quote)
	str.addAttribute(.font, value: UIFont.boldSystemFont(ofSize: 20), range: NSRange(location: 4, length: 5))
	str.addAttribute(.foregroundColor, value: UIColor.brown, range: NSRange(location: 10, length: 5))
	str.addAttribute(.link, value: NSURL(string: "http://apple.com")!, range: NSRange(location: 16, length: 3))
	str.addAttribute(.underlineStyle, value: 1, range: NSRange(location: 16, length: 3))
	str.addAttribute(.baselineOffset, value: 4, range: NSRange(location: 26, length: 4))
	return str
}()

var body: some View {
	VStack {
		//...
		Color.blue.frame(height: 10)
		HStack {
			Color.red.frame(width: 10, height: 10)
			AttributedText(weirdText)
				.background(Color.green.opacity(0.5))
			Color.red.frame(width: 150, height: 10)
		}
		Color.blue.frame(height: 10)
		//...
	}
}
```

## Considerations

The view internally is using the following "layers":

- `AttributedText` is embedding `WrappedTextView` only for its size calculation by means of a `GeometryReader` and the usual `PreferenceKey` dance.
- `WrappedTextView` is the `UIViewRepresentable` bridging between SwiftUI and UIKit
- `WrappedTextView` uses the final `AttributedUITextView` to render the attributed string
- `AttributedUITextView` is a subclass from `UITextView`

Although this code is used in production, it has some weaknesses I'd like to point out:

- "sometimes" SwiftUI complains of repeated size calculations (but succeeds anyway). I've tried to minimize the size calculations but please report any bugs in that regard.
- a static extension on `NSAttributedString` is used to calculate the final height, this is according to Apples sample code but conceptionally decoupled from the UITextView rendering the text - meh
- this code does not deal with building `NSAttributedString` - there are other libraries (e.g. https://github.com/psharanda/Atributika) doing that.
- in particular, converting html to attributed strings is not covered here.
- modifying the content by means of SwiftUI modifiers (e.g. `.foreground(Color.red)`) is not supported (as I have no idea how to propagate these changes down to a `UIViewPresentable` - get in contact if you know how)

## Installation

Embed it as a SwiftPM package: `https://github.com/omichde/AttributedText` - it should work in iOS 13 and above...
